      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Meeting minutes are notes that are taken during a meeting to record what happens in the meeting. These notes typically highlight the key issues that are discussed in the meeting. Meeting minutes should indicate the time, date, and setting of the meeting. These notes should also document who was in attendance at the meeting. If there are any presentations or reports presented, these should be reflected in the meeting minutes.

        Meeting minutes can be a valuable resource for team members who missed a meeting. Taking clear, detailed meeting minutes can help anyone who wasnâ€™t in attendance get caught up on any decisions or takeaways from the meeting.</p>
